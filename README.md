# Ensembling Machine Learning Models for Urdu FakeNews Detection

Fake news detection is recognized as a key natural language processing task. Recognizing the importanceof the task, several attempts have been made for fake news detection in Western languages. However,fake news detection in Urdu has received little attention of researchers. A key reason to that is thescarcity of fake news datasets for Urdu. In order to promote research and development in the area, atrack is dedicated to the second fake news detection in the Urdu language, UrduFake‚Äô21. This studyhas proposed to use ensembling machine learning models for Urdu fake news detection. The proposedapproach employs a voting-based approach of the three most effective techniques to decide that the givennews article is fake or real. For the evaluation of the proposed approach, experiments are performedusing several classical machine learning techniques, three types of features, unigram, bigram and trigramand the released dataset. The results of the experiments revealed that the proposed approach is moreeffective than the individual techniques. According to the results released by the organizers our proposedapproach achieved a macro average F1 and accuracy scores of 0.621 and 0.713, respectively, and it isranked4ùë°‚Ñéamong the19submissions.
